* Readme.md:
A repository for keeping up with my code from "Lisp from Nothing".

** Things I am currently worried/preoccupied with:
  1. Whether I can run the entire thing at the end with no major/minor problems.
  2. Whether the name conflicts will be a problem given that I change the names of some obscure functions.
